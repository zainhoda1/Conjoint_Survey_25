# Welcome to our survey!

Hi! We are a research team at George Washington University. This survey will ask you questions regarding your purchase preference for **used cars**.

This survey will take about **15 minutes** to complete. It can be
stopped and picked up at any time. Your personal information will be
kept confidential and won't be shared with anyone else. The survey is
subdivided in six sub-sections:

-   Current vehicle information

-   Future vehicle information

-   Vehicle fuel type choice questions

-   Electric vehicle choice questions

-   Knowledge of electric vehicles

-   Demographic Information


**We greatly appreciate your participation!**

# Consent

## Informed Consent for Participation in a Research Study

You are invited to participate in a research study directed by Dr. John Paul Helveston of the Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering at George Washington University (GWU). This study is funded by the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Participation is entirely voluntary and you may obtain further information regarding this study by contacting us at gwuvehiclegroup25\@gmail.com .

The purpose of this study is to better understand vehicle ownership patterns and preferences across different communities. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to complete an online survey, which will take approximately **15 minutes**. You may refuse to answer any of the questions and stop participating at any time.

**Benefits**: The most important reason why someone would like to participate in this study is that they can share their vehicle ownership
needs and help inform electric vehicle policies. You will not benefit directly from your participation in the study. However, the benefits to science and humankind that might result from this study include advancing our understanding of consumer decision-making in the vehicle market.

**Concerns/Risks**: You may not choose to volunteer for this study if you do not want to share information about your vehicle choices and certain personal details. Possible risks or discomforts you could experience during this study include: (1)
Although very unlikely, there is a risk of email address information being compromised if it is shared and in case our systems are compromised. (2) Psychological stress could be caused by the time and effort spent answering the survey.

**Confidentiality**: Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential. However, this cannot be guaranteed. The data will be stored in a secured online database which only the PI and student researchers can access. If the results of this study are reported in journals or at scientific meetings, participants of this study will not be named or identified.

**Additional Information**: The Office of Human Research of George Washington University, at telephone number (202) 994-2715, can provide
further information about your rights as a research participant. Your willingness to participate in this research study is implied if you proceed.

**Participation to this survey is voluntary. To take a part in this
survey, you must:**

-   Be at least 18 years old.
-   Authorize us to analyze your data exclusively for research purposes.

By clicking on "**I Agree**", you confirm that you have reviewed and understood the information provided in the welcome page and this consent
page, and agree to participate in the survey.

## Below are some questions about your household.

**We’ll start with a few questions about the vehicles your household owns or leases.** 
<br>
- Please consider all passenger vehicles – including cars, SUVs, vans, and trucks – but exclude motorcycles.
<br>
- Your household includes all the persons who occupy the housing unit as their usual place of residence.
<br>
- The table below describes each type of passenger vehicle. 
<br>

| Types of Powertrains   | Powertrain Definition   | Examples  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| Conventional ![](images/gas_pump.png) | Gasoline or other liquid-fuel engine, such as diesel or flex-fuel.| Honda Civic, Ford Explorer |
| Gas hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)![](images/gas_pump.png) | Smaller gasoline engine + electric motor + small battery. The gasoline engine recharges the battery to improve fuel efficiency. | Toyota Prius, Ford Escape Hybrid |
| Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)![](images/gas_pump.png) ![](images/electric_plug.png) | Hybrid that can also be plugged into an electrical outlet to charge the battery. Runs on electricity for a short range (10 – 40 miles), then switches to gasoline. | Kia Niro, Toyota RAV4 Prime |
| Battery electric vehicle (BEV) ![](images/electric_plug.png)| Electric motor only. Must be plugged into an electrical outlet to be refueled.  | Nissan Leaf, Tesla Model Y |

## Vehicle Educational Page

Great Work! Now that you have shared a bit about yourself, we'd like you to consider a scenario in which you can **choose a used vehicle from a set of vehicles with different attributes**.

Let's learn about the attributes.


| Types of Powertrain   | Powertrain Definition   | Examples  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| Conventional ![](images/gas_pump.png) | Gasoline or other liquid-fuel engine, such as diesel or flex-fuel.| Honda Civic, Ford Explorer |
| Gas hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)![](images/gas_pump.png) | Smaller gasoline engine + electric motor + small battery. The gasoline engine recharges the battery to improve fuel efficiency. | Toyota Prius, Ford Escape Hybrid |
| Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)![](images/gas_pump.png) ![](images/electric_plug.png) | Hybrid that can also be plugged into an electrical outlet to charge the battery. Runs on electricity for a short range (10 – 40 miles), then switches to gasoline. | Kia Niro, Toyota RAV4 Prime |
| Battery electric vehicle (BEV) ![](images/electric_plug.png)| Electric motor only. Must be plugged into an electrical outlet to be refueled.  | Nissan Leaf, Tesla Model Y

|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| ![](images/year5.JPG){fig-align="left" width="200"}     | **Model Year -** The actual year the vehicle was made.                                                                                                 |
| ![](images/odometer.jpeg){fig-align="left" width="200"}  | **Mileage -** The number of miles a vehicle has traveled.                                                                                             |
| ![](images/oper_cost.png){fig-align="left" width="800"} | **Operating Cost (Equivalent Gasoline Fuel Efficiency) -** Cost in cents per mile driven of fueling the vehicle. The equivalent fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (MPG) of a conventional gasoline vehicle is displayed in parenthesis.
