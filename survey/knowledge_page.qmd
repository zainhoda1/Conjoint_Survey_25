Great Work! Now that you have shared a bit about yourself, we'd like you to consider a scenario in which you can choose a car from a set of cars with different attributes.

Let's learn about the attributes.

<br>

| **Types of Powertrain**           | **Definition**                                                                                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Gasoline ![](images/gas_pump.png) | A conventional gasoline vehicle uses only gasoline.                                                                     |
| Hybrid (HEVs)                     | A hybrid vehicle uses a small battery to reduce fuel use but cannot be plugged in to recharge as it uses only gasoline. |
| Plug-in Hybrid (PHEVs)            | A plug-in hybrid vehicle has a battery which can be plugged in recharge and can also use gasoline.                      |
| Electric (BEVs)                   | A battery electric vehicle must be plugged in to recharge its battery - it never uses gasoline.                         |

| Powertrain                                           | Does the vehicle run on gas or Electricity?                       |
| Range                                                | How many miles in a full tank/ fully charged battery              |
| Price                                                | What is the price of the vehicle                                  |
| Model Year                                           | Model/Manufacturing year is the actual year the vehicle was built |
| Mileage                                              | The number of miles vehicle has travelled while in operation      |
| Operating Cost (Equivalent Gasoline Fuel Efficiency) | Operating cost of the vehicle                                     |
