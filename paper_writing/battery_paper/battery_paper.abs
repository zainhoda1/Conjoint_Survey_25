This data collection instrument provides guideline and some example survey questions aimed at understanding consumer preferences and willingness to pay for battery health information in the used battery electric vehicle (BEV) market. The potential survey design includes questions about current vehicle information, future vehicle preferences, a discrete choice experiment (DCE), EV knowledge, and demographics. The DCE systematically varies both standard vehicle attributes (e.g., price, mileage) and battery-specific features (e.g., state-of-health, refurbishment history) to quantify the economic value consumers place on battery-related information. Findings from this research project will improve the understanding of second-life battery markets, and guide future research in the evolving used EV landscape.
