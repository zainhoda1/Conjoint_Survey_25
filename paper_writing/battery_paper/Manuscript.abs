This study examines consumer perceptions, knowledge, and adoption patterns of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), using survey data from 1,443 U.S. residents. Findings reveal persistent informational and psychological barriers that hinder adoption among current non-adopters and challenge sustained use among current adopters. A binary logit model distinguishes \textit{BEV-only users} and \textit{BEV-mixed-fuel users}, uncovering distinct socio-demographic profiles, motivations, vehicle usage, and charging behaviors often obscured in aggregate analyses. \textit{BEV-only users} are typically younger, urban, and price-sensitive, often lacking dedicated charging access, whereas \textit{mixed-fuel users} place greater value on BEVs’ symbolic appeal and mitigate range concerns through access to conventional vehicles. A multinomial logit model of non-adopters shows that BEV-related perceptions, knowledge, incentives, infrastructure access, and personal traits affect adoption intentions in asymmetric ways. These findings highlight the need for flexible modeling and measurement of adoption to capture the complex and varied drivers of BEV resistance and uptake across different consumer groups.
