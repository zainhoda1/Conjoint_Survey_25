Testing likelihood function.
10 separate runs will be conducted, each using a random subset of 90% of
  individuals for estimation, and the remainder for validation.
Number of individuals
- for estimation : 270
- for forecasting : 30
- in sample (total): 300
Estimated parameters and log-likelihoods for each sample will be written to:
  /Users/xnw17/Documents/GitHub/Conjoint_Survey_25/code/output/model_output/apollo/vehicle/LC_2c_indicator_10_outOfSample_params.csv
The matrix defining the observations used in each repetition will be written
  to:
  /Users/xnw17/Documents/GitHub/Conjoint_Survey_25/code/output/model_output/apollo/vehicle/LC_2c_indicator_10_outOfSample_samples.csv
